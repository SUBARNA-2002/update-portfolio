        I am a dedicated and passionate web developer with a strong foundation
        in modern web technologies. My journey in the tech world began with two
        enriching internships where I immersed myself in the dynamics of web
        development, honing my skills and gaining practical experience. These
        formative experiences paved the way for my current role at Squbix
        Digital, where I work as a Software Developer.

        Since joining Squbix Digital in January, I have been instrumental in
        crafting responsive and user-centric applications using React and React
        Native. My proficiency in JavaScript enables me to develop dynamic
        functionalities, while my expertise in Tailwind CSS and Bootstrap
        ensures that the applications I build are not only functional but also
        aesthetically pleasing. I thrive in collaborative environments,
        continually aiming to deliver solutions that exceed client expectations
        and contribute positively to the digital landscape.
